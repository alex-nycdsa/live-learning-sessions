### Data Analytics through The Lens of Random Forests - An Example on Crash Analysis
<hr> 

- The classical data analysis often starts with dataframe manipulation and data visualization. Through trials and errors, the analyst gains valuable insights regarding the data through a manual and bottom-up fashion.
- While this is the standard way of performing data analysis, it faces a bottleneck when the data becomes complicated.
- Through the real-world NY state vehicle crash event data, we demonstrate that ML technique, particularly the feature importance derived by random forests, can help to guide the data analysis procedure from a top-to-bottom angle, which makes data analytics more scalable w.r.t. the complexity of the data.
